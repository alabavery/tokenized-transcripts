This will be used to help language learners create practice sessions from audio recordings with paired transcriptions.  The rationale for the project is as follows: Listening practice is incredibly important for learning a new language, but often, we can't find much audio content that is within our competency level.  Often, we will understand a few phrases here and there, but, ideally, you should pratice with material of which you understand 80-90%.  This project will give learners audio material of which they understand 80%-90% by taking little snippets from a bunch of different sources and combining them.
